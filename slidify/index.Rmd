## Project Description

This project was created as the project coursework for Data Products course.

It uses the mtcars dataset and plots the linear regression of a predictor variable
and the resulting miles per gallon ("mpg").

The working shiny app can be accessed at <https://rgucci.shinyapps.io/test1>

## The "mtr" cars data set used

```{r}
names(mtcars)
```

---

## Instructions

- First, select the predictor variable (hp, cyl, wt, etc.)
- Next, the linear regression for "mpg" will automatically be plotted in relation to the predictor variable selected in the first step

---

## Sample Output (mpg ~ hp)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
    with(mtcars, {
        plot(mpg ~ hp,xlab="cyl",ylab="mpg")
        abline(lm(mpg~hp,data=mtcars),col=2)
    })
```
